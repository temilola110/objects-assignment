// Musa Dawodu is a 19 years old Nigerian male who lives with his parents in Lekki, Lagos State. Recently, he wrote the JAMB exam and had the following scores in his combination:
// ENG - 70
// GOVT - 85
// LIT - 82
// CRK - 94

// Using the factory method, implement a createPerson() factory function that takes name, age and location as arguments. Afterwards, create an object representing Musa from the factory function. 
// Also, implement a factory function createJambScores() that takes eng, govt, lit, crk as arguments. Then create an object representing Museâ€™s JAMB scores. Add the object as a property to Musa object you created above in (a) above
